
The documentation for ACHP is entirely written in ReST, a minimally restructed file format.

There is a lot of information online on using ReST, particularly with Python.  Some good places to look are:

 -- http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/sampledoc/
 -- http://sphinx.pocoo.org/tutorial.html
 
To build the ACHP docs, you will need:

    A LaTeX distribution
    Python
    the matplotlib package for Python
    
Then, to build the docs, either just click on make.py (on windows), or on any operating system, enter this at a command prompt in this directory

python make.py

and it should generate the HTML and PDF versions

Good luck, any questions, email me (ian.h.bell@gmail.com)
